## 👨‍💻 My Contribution

As a core team member of the **Real-Time Data Analysis and Visualization Platform Using Power BI**, my responsibilities spanned across both data engineering and business intelligence layers of the system. My contribution was focused on three major aspects of the project: **Data Pipeline Development**, **Data Processing with Azure Databricks** and **Interactive Dashboard Design in Power BI**.

---

### 🔄 Data Pipeline Development (Azure Integration)

- **Designed and implemented the end-to-end data pipeline** to ingest and process structured data from both CSV uploads and API endpoints.
- Built a **robust and scalable architecture using Azure Data Factory (ADF)** to orchestrate data movement, transformation and loading workflows.
- Configured pipeline triggers to **automatically detect and process newly uploaded data**, minimizing manual intervention and latency.
- Ensured real-time ingestion performance using **streaming datasets and batch triggers** where appropriate.

---

### ⚙️ Data Processing with Azure Databricks (PySpark)

- Developed and maintained **PySpark notebooks on Azure Databricks** to handle preprocessing tasks such as:
  - Data cleaning (removing duplicates, handling missing values)
  - Schema validation and transformation
  - Aggregation and enrichment for metrics calculation
- Leveraged the distributed nature of Databricks to **scale data processing for larger datasets**, enabling near real-time performance.
- Designed a modular notebook structure for **reusability and maintainability** in future use cases and team handovers.

### 📊 Power BI Dashboard Development & Deployment

- Created **interactive, real-time dashboards in Power BI Desktop** to present KPIs, trends, and insights in a visually compelling and intuitive manner.
- Enabled **real-time streaming visuals** using Power BI’s push dataset features and integrated dashboards into the web platform.
- Implemented advanced Power BI features including:
  - **Slicers, filters, and drill-down** for dynamic exploration
  - **Custom DAX measures** for calculated insights
  - Optimized visuals for performance using **DirectQuery and incremental refresh**
- Deployed dashboards on **Power BI Service**, set up **role-based access**, and ensured secure sharing and access control.
- Significantly reduced dashboard latency (from 30+ seconds to <5 seconds) for **near-instant insights**, enhancing end-user experience.

---

### 🚀 Impact of My Work

- **Streamlined the flow of real-time data from ingestion to visualization**, bridging the gap between backend engineering and frontend analytics.
- Played a vital role in ensuring that **non-technical users (faculty, admins)** could access up-to-date, actionable insights with minimal complexity.
- Improved overall performance and user satisfaction by contributing to **automation, scalability, and visual clarity** of the platform.
- Enabled **future extensibility** by designing reusable, modular components in both Databricks and Power BI layers.
